# Plant Management System
HackHSV 2017

# Inspiration
Astronauts probably don't make the best farmers

# What it does
Keeps up with information from various crop fields without a need for a remote server

# How we built it
JSON stored in local cookies in order to communicate data CSS and JavaScript used to dynamically represent the information

# Challenges we ran into
We weren't used to working on the same set of code with other people in real time. There was definitely an adjustment period for GIT during which merges were a pain.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
The whole thing. The level of polish we managed is far higher than what we expected to achieve.

# What we learned
We all learned quite a bit about web development in general and working as a team

# What's next for the Plant Management System
Next would be integration for sensors and mechanisms to control the PH etc...

# Built With
HTML, CSS, Javascript=
